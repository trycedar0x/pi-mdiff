Here we ask Pi to build a custom workflow extension with custom TUI to streamline the commit and push process.

This is just a small selection of models you can pick from.

You can rewind to any prior message, branch from there and share the entire session with others.

Pi supports skills, AGENTS.md files and is very token efficient due to its minimal system prompt.

Press Enter to steer the current run immediately, or Alt+Enter to queue a follow-up once it finishes.

We use the Pi TUI here to build a Pi based shell script that uses print mode.

This demonstrates a more heavily customized Pi installation using the third-party extension [@termdraw/pi](https://github.com/benvinegar/termdraw/) by [Ben Vinegar](https://github.com/benvinegar/) that lets you draw.

## Why Pi?

Pi - manipulate the website

Pi is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt Pi to your workflows, not the other way around. Customize Pi with [extensions](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#extensions), [skills](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#skills), [prompt templates](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#prompt-templates), and [themes](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#themes). Bundle them as [Pi packages](https://pi.dev/packages) and share via npm or git.

Pi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub-agents and plan mode. Ask Pi to build what you want, or install a package that does it your way.

Four modes: interactive, print/JSON, [RPC, and SDK](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#programmatic-usage). See [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw) for a real-world integration.

## Change the harness, not your workflow

Pi - Build a custom workflow extension

Pi isn't a sealed product. If you need a command, tool, provider, workflow, or UI tweak, just ask Pi to build it. It will customize itself on the fly.

Have Pi manipulate itself in place, hit `/reload`, and keep going. If you think others will find what you built useful, share it!

## 15+ providers, hundreds of models

Pi - Switch models mid-session

Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure, Bedrock, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, xAI, Hugging Face, Kimi For Coding, MiniMax, OpenRouter, Ollama, and more. Authenticate via API keys or OAuth.

Switch models mid-session with `/model` or `Ctrl+L`. Cycle through your favorites with `Ctrl+P`.

Add custom providers and models via [models.json](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md) or [extensions](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/custom-provider.md).

## Tree-structured, shareable history

Pi - Branch and share a session tree

Sessions are stored as trees. Use `/tree` to navigate to any previous point and continue from there. All branches live in a single file. Filter by message type, label entries as bookmarks.

Export to HTML with `/export`, or upload to a GitHub gist with `/share` and get a shareable URL that renders it. [Example session](https://pi.dev/session/#0ea51497613daf7e1de28ee99950b074).

## Context engineering

Pi - Load project skills and instructions

Pi's [minimal system prompt](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts) and extensibility let you do actual context engineering. Control what goes into the context window and how it's managed.

**AGENTS.md:** Project instructions loaded at startup from `~/.pi/agent/`, parent directories, and the current directory.

**SYSTEM.md:** Replace or append to the default system prompt per-project.

**Compaction:** Auto-summarizes older messages when approaching the context limit. Fully customizable via [extensions](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/custom-compaction.ts): implement topic-based compaction, code-aware summaries, or use different summarization models.

**Skills:** Capability packages with instructions and tools, loaded on-demand. Progressive disclosure without busting the prompt cache. See [skills](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#skills).

**Prompt templates:** Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand. See [prompt templates](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#prompt-templates).

**Dynamic context:** [Extensions](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent#extensions) can inject messages before each turn, filter the message history, implement RAG, or build long-term memory.

## Steer or follow up

Pi - Steer a running agent

Submit messages while the agent works. `Enter` sends a steering message (delivered after current tool, interrupts remaining tools). `Alt+Enter`sends a follow-up (waits until the agent finishes).

## Four modes

Pi - Generate a shell script in print mode

**Interactive:** The full TUI experience.

**Print/JSON:**`pi -p "query"` for scripts, `--mode json` for event streams.

**RPC:** JSON protocol over stdin/stdout for non-Node integrations. See [docs/rpc.md](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md).

**SDK:** Embed Pi in your apps. See [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw) for a real-world example.

## Primitives, not features

Pi - Install a third-party extension

Features that other agents bake in, you can build yourself. Extensions are TypeScript modules with access to tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, events, and the full TUI.

[Sub-agents](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/), [plan mode](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/plan-mode/), [permission gates](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/permission-gate.ts), [path protection](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/protected-paths.ts), [SSH execution](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/ssh.ts), [sandboxing](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/sandbox/), MCP integration, custom editors, status bars, overlays.

Don't want to build it? Ask Pi to build it for you. Or install a [package](https://pi.dev/packages) that does it your way. See the [50+ examples](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/).

Bundle extensions, skills, prompts, and themes as packages. Install from npm or git:

`$ pi install npm:@foo/pi-tools
$ pi install git:github.com/badlogic/pi-doom`
